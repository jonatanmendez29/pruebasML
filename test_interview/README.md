# ML Engineer - Technical Interview
I designed a technical interview for a Mid-to-Senior ML Engineer with a focus on backend and production ML systems. 
The interview cover:

- Advanced Python and Software Design
- Shell Scripting and Automation
- AWS and Cloud Infrastructure for ML
- ML Pipeline and System Design
- Distributed Computing and Performance Optimization
- MLOps and Collaboration with Data Scientists

## Structure sections

_Let's assume a 60-minute interview and we want to cover all areas._

1. Python Programming and Software Design
2. ML System Design
3. AWS & Distributed Systems
4. MLOps & Production Readiness

## Part 1: Python & Software Engineering Fundamentals (20 minutes)
**Coding Exercise**:
```Python
# Problem: Design a scalable data processor for ML training
# Requirements:
# - Process batches of data with different schemas
# - Handle missing values and data validation
# - Make it extensible for new data types
# - Ensure thread-safety for concurrent processing

# Starter code:
class DataProcessor:
    pass
```
### Follow-up Questions:

1. How would you make this class modular and extensible for new data types? 
2. What design patterns would you apply for validation and transformation logic? 
3. How would you handle memory management with large datasets? 
4. Discuss your approach to error handling and logging.

## Part 2: ML System Design (25 minutes)
**Scenario**: "Design an ML pipeline for real-time recommendation system serving 10M users"

**Assessment Areas**:

- **Data Pipeline Design**:
  - How would you handle feature engineering and serving? 
  - Discuss batch vs real-time feature computation 
  - Data versioning and schema evolution

- **Model Training & Deployment**:
  - Training pipeline architecture 
  - A/B testing strategy for model updates 
  - Model monitoring and drift detection

- **Infrastructure & Scaling**:
  - AWS services selection (SageMaker vs custom containers)
  - Auto-scaling strategies 
  - Cost optimization considerations

---
## Part 3: AWS & Distributed Systems (15 minutes)
**Technical Questions**:

1. "Walk me through deploying a model on AWS from development to production"
2. "How would you design a distributed training system for large datasets?"
3. "Compare SageMaker, ECS, and EKS for ML workloads"
4. "How do you handle model versioning and rollbacks in production?"

**Scenario**: "Your model inference latency increased by 300% overnight. Walk me through your debugging process."

---
## Part 4: MLOps & Production Readiness (15 minutes)
**Practical Problems**:

1. **CI/CD for ML**:
   - "Design a CI/CD pipeline for ML models"
   - How would you automate testing of model quality? 
   - Discuss your approach to reproducible builds 
2. **Monitoring & Observability**:
   - What metrics would you monitor in production? 
   - How do you detect data drift and concept drift? 
   - Discuss your experience with MLflow, Airflow, or similar tools
3. Shell Scripting & Automation:
   - "Write a shell script to automate model retraining pipeline"
   - How would you schedule and monitor periodic jobs?

# **Evaluation Rubric**

## **Technical Skills Matrix:**

| **Area** | **Weight** | **Evaluation Criteria** |
|----------|------------|-------------------------|
| **Python & OOP** | 25% | Code quality, design patterns, modularity, error handling |
| **ML System Design** | 30% | Architecture decisions, scalability, trade-off analysis |
| **AWS & Infrastructure** | 20% | Service selection, cost optimization, deployment strategies |
| **MLOps & Production** | 15% | Monitoring, CI/CD, reproducibility, best practices |
| **Problem Solving** | 10% | Debugging approach, analytical thinking, communication |

## **Senior-Level Differentiators:**
**Look for candidates who:**
- Ask clarifying questions about requirements and constraints
- Discuss trade-offs between different approaches
- Consider monitoring and observability from the start
- Mention security, cost, and maintenance implications
- Provide multiple solutions with pros/cons

## **Practical Exercises to Consider:**

1. **Code Review:** Provide a piece of ML pipeline code with intentional issues
2. **System Diagram:** Ask to whiteboard a production ML system
3. **Debugging Session:** Present production logs and ask for root cause analysis
4. **Shell Script Challenge:** Automate a deployment or monitoring task

## **Red Flags:**
- Cannot explain basic system design trade-offs
- Poor code organization and lack of error handling
- No consideration for monitoring or production realities
- Unable to discuss past production experience in detail
- Focuses only on modeling accuracy, not system reliability

_This interview structure comprehensively assesses all core requirements while identifying candidates who can bridge the gap between data science and production engineering._
